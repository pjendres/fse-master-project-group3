## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).



I honestly have no idea how to operate this lol. I put my files into bin and src, is that like the right place? Anyways I am posting my game to main, it has about 3 sectors left that i am looking to finish eventually. The file is sketch.js and it is in the bin as well as the src folders. The game does have music but im figuring out on how to import them. 

Update: I got the file in the src folder. 

Also the index.html section has this <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/p5.collide2d"></script> which is needed to make the game functions properly.
